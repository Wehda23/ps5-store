## üêç Create Virtual Environment

If you are running this project in a development stage, it is advised to use a Python virtual environment.

- To create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

- To activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

## üèÉ Run Application

To run the application, you need to have Python installed on your machine.

- Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

This project utilizes the following database schema to manage and organize data efficiently. The schema defines the structure, relationships, and constraints for the database tables.

![Database Schema](https://i.imghippo.com/files/GQdfW1717777832.png)

The diagram provides a visual representation of the tables, columns, and their relationships, ensuring a clear understanding of the data flow and organization within the system.


## üåê Hosting with Nginx and Gunicorn

To host the application using Nginx and Gunicorn, follow these instructions.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a server running on DigitalOcean or a similar service.
- Install necessary software packages.

### Step 1: Install Gunicorn

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

### Step 2: Create a Gunicorn Systemd Service

Create a file at `/etc/systemd/system/myproject.service` with the following content:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance to serve myproject
After=network.target

[Service]
User=yourusername
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/home/yourusername/myproject
Environment="PATH=/home/yourusername/myproject/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/home/yourusername/myproject/venv/bin/gunicorn --workers 3 --bind unix:myproject.sock -m 007 wsgi:app

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Step 3: Start and Enable the Gunicorn Service

```bash
sudo systemctl start myproject
sudo systemctl enable myproject
```

### Step 4: Install Nginx

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

### Step 5: Configure Nginx

Create a file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject` with the following content:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_or_IP;

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/yourusername/myproject/myproject.sock;
    }
}
```

Enable the file by creating a symlink:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myproject /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

### Step 6: Test Nginx Configuration and Restart

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
