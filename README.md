## Prerequisites

- Node.js and Yarn
- Python and pip

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ps5-store.git
   cd ps5-store
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies for the backend:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd ..
   ```

## Scripts

The following scripts are available to manage the different projects in the monorepo:

- **Start Admin Login Frontend:**

  ```bash
  yarn start:admin_login
  ```

- **Start Management Frontend:**

  ```bash
  yarn start:managment
  ```

- **Start Staff Frontend:**

  ```bash
  yarn start:staff
  ```

- **Start Store Frontend:**

  ```bash
  yarn start:store
  ```

- **Start Backend:**

  ```bash
  yarn start:backend
  ```

- **Start All (Frontend and Backend):**

  ```bash
  yarn start:all
  ```

## Running the Project

To start both the Flask backend and the React frontend (Store), run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
yarn start:all
```

This command uses `concurrently` to start both the backend and the frontend servers simultaneously. The backend will run on port 5000 by default, and the frontend will run on port 3000 by default.

## Frontend (React)

The React frontend handles the user interface and makes API calls to the backend.

### Example API Call

In your React components, you can make API calls to the backend like this:

```jsx
import axios from 'axios';

const handleLogin = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5000/login', {
      username,
      password,
    });
    localStorage.setItem('token', response.data.access_token);
    window.location.href = '/management';
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error logging in', error);
  }
};
```
